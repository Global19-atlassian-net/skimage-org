## Why we think scikit-image is a good fit for NumFOCUS

scikit-image falls squarely within the open source scientific software focus of NumFOCUS.  The library furthermore aligns well with NumFOCUS's goals and values.

## How scikit-image has met the requirements on the NumFOCUS website

*  How accepting **scikit-image** furthers the NumFOCUS [mission](https://numfocus.org/community/mission)

   `scikit-image` is a well-established library in the scientific Python ecosystem. Its mission ([https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/values.html](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/values.html)) is to be the reference library for scientific image analysis in Python, a goal that fits well within NumFOCUS's own mission.  `scikit-image` is committed to being inclusive and community-driven, while focusing on science and education.

*  How accepting **scikit-image** is an effective way to allocate NumFOCUS resources

   This is ultimately for the board to decide, but of course we believe that we are good stewards in the community, and strengthen it through our participation in it.

*  How does your project relate to or integrate with the existing ecosystem of NumFOCUS tools?

   The tool was the second scikit, after scikit-learn, and has been developed inside of the NumFOCUS ecosystem of tools with interoperability explicitly in mind since day one.

*  The project must release its code under an OSI approved open source license.

   The code is BSD. Tutorials are CC0.

*  The project must have a Code of Conduct, either adopted from [http://www.numfocus.org/code-of-conduct.html](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) or similar in spirit.

   https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html
   
   `scikit-image` follows the SciPy code of conduct, and has a code of conduct committee for handling reports.

*  The project has to have a community that's active and of reasonable size, as evidenced by commits, mailing list conversations, etc.

   We have 300+ contributors, and a core team >10.  We have an online chat forum at [https://skimage.zulipchat.com](https://skimage.zulipchat.com), and mailing list archives at [https://mail.python.org/archives/list/scikit-image@python.org/](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/scikit-image@python.org/). We share a user forum with several other image analysis tools at https://forum.image.sc/tags/scikit-image.

*  The project must have multiple people willing to sign the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement who are active in the project; one person may be an external stakeholder instead of a project contributor.

   The agreement will be signed by our steering council.

The signatories on the FSA will be (please list name and affiliation):

> 1. Stéfan van der Walt, UC Berkeley

> 2. Juan Nunez-Iglesias, Monash University

> 3. Emmanuelle Gouillart, Plotly

> 4. Joshua Warner, University of Arizona

> 5. Zachary Pincus, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis

## Past/present projects around scikit-image

## Future plans

We have recently formalized our proposal process.  Scikit-Image Proposals, or SKIPs, will appear at https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/skips/. We plan to organize these into a coherent roadmap at the next core developer sprint.

## scikit-image hackathons/workshops/conferences

We present a tutorial and sprint annually at the SciPy conference.  We have also, upon occasion, done the same at other conferences. From time to time, we organize sprints, such as the joint scikit-image/scikit-learn/dask sprint held 28 May to 2 June at Berkeley.
